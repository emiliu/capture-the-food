                <h2>Premise</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You play the part of a cat with a particular dislike for its owners.</li>
                    <li>To act out your kitty hatred, you carefully track mud through each and every room of your house.</li>
                    <li>However, you also strongly dislike having to retrace your steps.</li>
                    <li>In addition, in some rooms there are locked spaces. You want to get mud on those spaces too, so you have to first get a key.</li>
                    <li>Luckily, one key will unlock any lock in the room.</li>
                    <li>In anticipation of your antics, your owners have also put out mats (like the start and finish mats) which will never get muddy. That means you can step on them however many times as you like, or even not at all.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the arrow keys to navigate through each room. On touchscreens, swipe in the appropriate direction.</li>
                    <li>Click the restart button or press <code>r</code> to restart the level.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="center">Good Luck!</h2>
